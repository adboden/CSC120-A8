Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class is a class that allows a user to perform actions on an ASCII created bird. It is able to move around the terminal and interact with text objects. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I also implemented a constructor that held variables used in later methods and created a display method, so that I was able to see what my bird looked like before implementing additional methods with it.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I had a lot of fun completing this assignment, but I think it was a little difficult to implement all methods in the interface, because some were a little hard to assign to the vision I had in mind. Overall, it was really fun, and I would recomment students in the future to have fun with this assignment!
